# Blackjack Project

## Week 3 Homework Project for Skill Distillery

## Overview
  The player will receive a pair of cards, and will decide to either Hit, Stay or request a New Hand upon examination of such. If the player decides to hit, the dealer will pass him a card which he the later adds to his hand. The player will again be prompted to either hit or stay. Moreover, if the player stays, the dealer will begin their turn. Upon the conclusion of the dealer's turn, the winner will be determined using Blackjack rules. Then a new hand is started automatically unless the player decides to quit.

## Technologies/Topics Applied

* do/while Loops.
* For each loops.
* For each loops
* Encapsulation
* Constructors
* Abstraction
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Java






## Lessons Learned
* Tried to stay away from utilizing variables to pass values. I instead stuck with the use of my objects and methods.

* Ensured class communication through the use of object manipulation and inheritance, this gave me the opportunity to do very specific method calls when I needed it.

* This project thought me how to organize my programs better, from the initial UML in my notebook to class inheritance. I learned to make sure that classes are talking to each-other properly.
